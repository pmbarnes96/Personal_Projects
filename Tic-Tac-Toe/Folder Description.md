This folder contains the source code in C++ for a basic Tic-Tac-Toe playing program I wrote.  It allows for human vs human, computer vs computer, or human vs computer play.  The computer uses the minimax algorithm [1] to choose the best move.  In a more complicated game such as chess, it is not computationally feasible for a program to search more than a small part of the game tree, and it must use a heuristic function to evaluate the possible resulting positions.  In Tic-Tac-Toe, not only is it feasible to search the entire game tree, it can be done fairly instantaneously by a modern computer.  This program, therefore, will always play the optimal move.  Because optimal play by both sides leads to a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe, it is not possible to beat this program.
