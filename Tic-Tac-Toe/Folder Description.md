This folder contains the source code in C++ for a basic Tic-Tac-Toe playing program I wrote.  It allows for human vs human, computer vs computer, or human vs computer play.  The computer uses the minimax algorithm [1] to always play optimal moves.  Because optimal play by both sides leads to a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe, it is not possible to beat the computer.
